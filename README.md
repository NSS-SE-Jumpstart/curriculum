# Software Engineering Jumpstart

Welcome to the Nashville Software School Software Engineering Jumpstart Course. We're glad you're here.

In this course you'll begin your coding journey. It will be a long trip with many twists and turns along the way that will eventually lead you deep into the mysteries of software engineering. This course won't take you all the way to the end, but it'll set you off in the right direction. And (hopefully) we'll have a little fun doing it.

This course is divided into nine sessions over three weeks.

## Next Steps

All good things must come to an end, and if you're reading this far you've completed (or are about to complete) this course. The following page has some suggestions on next steps/topics for you to research/experiment with as you continue your journey learning about programming.

- [Next Steps](./sessions/next-steps/)

It is a very common pattern to revisit code that you've previously written, and with the benefit of time and experience see new/better ways to do the same thing. After reading through the next steps, you may want to revisit the Clothesline project or any of the other exercises you've worked on during this course and see how you can incorporate some of these concepts into that code.
