## Data Type

A data type defines a set of legal values and operations.

_You know what? Honestly, it's a confusing concept and best described by way of examples. Here are some examples_

### `bool`

A Boolean type. `bool`s are either `True` or `False`. They are often used in `if` statements and `while` loops.

#### Example

```python
is_the_sky_blue = True

if is_the_sky_blue:
    print("We must be on Earth!")
```

### `float`

A number that includes a decimal point. The name `float` is a weird, archaic reference that, frankly, should be replaced.

#### Example

```python
GPA = 3.5

if GPA > 3.0:
    print("Pizza Party!")
else:
    print("Study Party...yay...woo...studying.......")
```

### `int`

An integer type. A number without a decimal. `int`s may be positive, negative or zero.

#### Example

```python
the_answer = 42
half_the_answer = the_answer / 2
one_more_than_the_answer = the_answer + 1

temp = -10
if temp < 0:
    print("It's much to cold. It should be less cold. Who do I see about that?")
```

### `list`

A collection type. A list contains zero or more elements. Each element is at a particular index. Index values start at zero. A list has a length.

#### Example

```python
empty_list = []
```

### `str`
