# Course Learning Objectives

The following are the learning objectives for this course. It is not necessary that you read through this list, but we've made it available in the interest of transparency. 

> **NOTE:** The order of this list does **not** reflect the importance of the objectives and doest **not** align with the order in which the course material is introduced. Basically, the order is arbitrary.

1. Recall that software is written in a specialized, text-based language called a programming language.
1. Recall that software that can be executed on a computer is called a program.
1. Remember that there are many different programming languages.
1. Remember that each programming language has the goal of instructing a computer. 
1. Remember that text written in a programming language is called source code or, simply, code.
1. Recall that Python is a programming language.
1. Understand that a program is made up of data and behavior. 
1. Understand that data is the information used by the program. 
1. Understand that behavior is the logic of a program. 
1. Recall that a comment is used to put regular english text within source code in order to make the code more understandable to other people.
1. Understand that a comment can be used to temporarily remove code without deleting it from the source code.
1. Remember that a variable is used to store data in a program. 
1. Explain what it means for source code to be case sensitive.
1. Remember that code is executed one line at a time in a top-down manner.
1. Remember that if/else statements are constructs used to conditionally execute some code.
1. Remember that loops are constructs used to execute code multiple times.
1. List two kinds of loops in Python.
1. Recognize that `list`, `str`, `int`, `float` and `bool` are all Python data types.
1. Write code to use `str()` to convert an integer to a string.
1. Write code that uses `int()` to convert a string to an integer.
1. Recall that a function is a way to group code together so that it can be executed as a unit.
1. Walk through and describe the code in a function. The function should have multiple lines, use at least one conditional and at least one loop.
1. Write code to create and initialize a variable with a string value.
1. Write code to create an if statement.
1. Write code to use a `for` loop to iterate over a list. 
1. Write code to create a while loop.
1. Write code to print text to the terminal.
1. Write code to print the contents of a variable to the terminal.
1. Recall that a function receives input via parameters
1. Write a function that prints its parameter to the terminal.
1. Recall that a value is the term used to indicate the data stored in a variable.
1. Remember that a Python list is used to store multiple values.
1. Remember that a Python list is zero-indexed.
1. Write code to create and initialize a list of strings.
1. Label literal values with their type for string, int, boolean, and list values.
1. Recall that addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators are special symbols that act on their operands.
1. Recall that a plus (+) operator can be used to concatenate two strings.
1. Recall that comparison operators can be used to compare numbers for greater than, less than or equality.
1. Recall that strings, numbers and booleans can be compared for equality.
1. Distinguish between assignment and equality operators.
1. Describe the behavior of joining two boolean expressions with an “and”.
1. Describe the behavior of joining two boolean expressions with an “or”.
1. Recall that even experienced software developers don’t know everything and regularly search for help online.
1. Use a search engine to find help with a programming problem.
1. Demonstrate listing the contents of a directory using `ls`.
1. Demonstrate creating a directory with `mkdir`.
1. Explain that files contain data. 
1. Compare a file to an image or a document.
1. Remember that a user can provide input to a program.
1. Write code that accepts input from a user.
1. Remember that output from an application can be displayed on the terminal.
1. Write code that outputs data to the terminal.
1. Recall that a text editor is an application used to edit text files.
1. Demonstrate running an application from the console. 
1. Remember that commonly used functionality is available from standard libraries/modules.
1. List an example  of a Python library that can be imported..
1. Write code that imports and uses some functionality from a standard library
1. Be able to download, install, and run Python 3.
1. Be able to download, install, and run Visual Studio Code.
1. Demonstrate running a Python program from the command line.
1. Recall that when a Python program fails it reports the error with a helpful message.
