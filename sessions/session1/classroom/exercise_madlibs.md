## Exercise - Mad Libs

It's practice time.

> **NOTE:** This is the first of many practice exercises you'll encounter throughout the course. In general, when working on practice exercises we'll open the Zoom breakout rooms so that you can move into smaller "rooms" to work. Some students find working solo be more natural whereas others prefer working with classmates. Whichever you prefer, we **strongly encourage** you to do some of each. In the real world, software developers spend lots of time doing heads-down, individual work, but generally **more** time working directly with other developers.

You're going to make a [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) game! Mad Libs prompt a user to enter words of a particular part of speech, and uses those words to complete a small (funny?) story.

1. Create a new directory within your `workspace` directory, and a Python file for the exercise. Remember to name things in such a way that you'll know what they are in a few weeks.

1. To start things off, write the code to print the message, "Welcome to Mad Libs!" followed by a blank line.

1. Run the program and confirm that the message is displayed.

    > **NOTE:** This _iterative_ technique - write a little code, run it to check the output, then repeat - is the way all software is created. You should **always** write as little code as possible before you run it.

1. Let's start the story with a main character. Prompt the user to enter a main character's name and then display the following message with the main character's name filling in the blank.

    > _____ went to the store.

    Make sure to test your code by running the program before moving on to the next step.

1. Next, prompt the user to enter the type of store and update your printed story to display the type of store.

    > _____ went to the _____ store.

1. Next, make the main character more interesting by giving them something to love. Prompt the user to enter a noun that the main character loves and update the printed story accordingly.

    > _____, the _____-lover, went to the _____ store.

1. Continue adding new inputs and updating the printed text in your code until you have a complete story. If you're feeling particularly creative, you can write your own story, otherwise, you can use the story below.

    > <u>main_character</u>, the <u>lovable-thing</u>-lover, went to the <u>store_type</u> store to buy a <u>purchase</u>. However, before reaching the <u>store_type</u> store, <u>main_character</u> encountered a large <u>threatening_creature</u> that threatened to <u>harm_verb</u> the world with a <u>harm_noun</u>. Fortunately, <u>main_character</u> defeated the large <u>threatening_creature</u> with a <u>defense_adjective</u> <u>defense_noun</u>.

    > **NOTE:** In the above story, we've labeled each blank to (hopefully) make things more clear. Also, note that some of the labels are used more than once. For example <u>main_character</u> is used three times.
