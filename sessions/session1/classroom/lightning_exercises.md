# Lightning Exercises

_Lightning exercises_ are quick coding practice exercises that we'll work as a group. First, we'll describe the question. Then, you'll have a few minutes to code up a solution. Finally, your instructors will present their solution.

---

For these exercises, you'll keep adding code to the bottom of the same Python file (`lightning.py`). This means each time you run the program, you'll see the output of the previous exercises above the exercise you're working on.

## Exercise 1

1. Create a new directory called `lightning` within your `workspace` directory.
1. Inside the `lightning` directory, create a new Python file called `session1.py`
1. Add code to print `Lightnin' Time!`
1. Run the program

## Exercise 2

1. Create a variable called `soup` and set it to the name of your favorite soup.
1. Print the `soup` variable.

## Exercise 3

1. Add new code to print the text, `Y'all need to know my favorite soup is`, followed by the name of your favorite soup. Make sure there's a space before the name of the soup.

## Exercise 4

1. Add new code to print the text, `Roger does not like soup! Not even __name-of-soup__! Roger has no taste!`.

For example, if your favorite soup is `tomato`, your code should print: 
`Roger does not like soup! Not even tomato! Roger has no taste!`.

## Exercise 5

1. Add new code to prompt the user to enter their favorite soup. Save the user's favorite soup into a variable called `other_soup`
1. Add two new print statements to print both yours and the user's favorite soups.

## Exercise 6

1. Add new code to ask the user if they like your favorite soup. Save their response in a variable.
1. Print the user's response.

If your favorite soup is `tomato`, your terminal should look something like this:

```txt
Do you like tomato soup? yes, of course
You said: yes, of course
```

## Demo

Here's a demonstration of the final program.
