# Interacting with the User

Our `hello_world` program is clearly fantastic. It's amazing. It's unbelievable. Nothing could be more exciting...Right?

OK, OK...It's boring.

A program that just prints messages isn't particularly interesting or useful. Software is meant to be a tool. It's meant to be used. A hammer that's just sitting on a workbench isn't doing anyone any good. A human must pick it up, must interact with it, must pound some nails or threaten some teenagers or _something_...or it's just useless.

Let's write some code that lets a user do something.

> **NOTE:** Whether or not our code will be _useful_ is up for debate, but, hopefully, when we're done, you'll be able to begin to imagine how to use these tools to build something more realistic.

## Accepting User Input

As we said above most useful programs are interactive. We've already seen how a program might communicate with a user using the `print()` function.

If our program were channeling Groucho Marx, for example...

```python
print("I never forget a face, but in your case Iâ€™d be glad to make an exception.")
```

Our programs can also get input from the user.

```python
favorite_golden_girl = input("Who's your favorite Golden Girl? ")

print("You said your favorite Golden Girl is " + favorite_golden_girl)
```

If you were to run the program it would look something like this:

```txt
$ python3 golden_girls.py 
Who's your favorite Golden Girl? Sophia
You said your favorite Golden Girl is Sophia
```
# ANIMATION

Let's go ahead and create this program.

1. Create a new `goldengirls` folder in your `workspace` folder.

    ```sh
    cd ~/workspace
    mkdir goldengirls
    cd goldengirls
    ```

1. Create a `golden_girls.py` file.

    In Windows
    ```powershell
    new-item golden_girls.py
    ```

    In macOS
    ```sh
    touch golden_girls.py
    ```

1. Open the `golden_girls.py` file in Visual Studio Code and **type in the code** from above. We know you may be tempted to copy and paste, but for now it's best to type it in.

1. Run the program.

### `input()`

The `input()` function is the counterpart to the `print()` function. `input()` asks the user to enter some information and then waits until they do. We can pass a string of text into the `input()` function that will be displayed to the user. This is often called a _prompt_. In the sample above we're prompting the user to give us the name of a Golden Girl.

```python
input("Who's your favorite Golden Girl? ")
```

Notice the extra space after the question mark. This space will be displayed in the terminal just like the rest of the prompt. It will add some visual buffer between the prompt and the text that the user types. Try removing the space and rerunning your program. It will still work, but it'll be just a bit harder to use.

### Variables

We've seen how a program can get input from a user, but then what? What does it do with the input?

We store it in a _variable_.

Let's think about an analogy. Imagine you go to a restaurant in which you can see the kitchen. You order a grilled cheese sandwich. You watch the cook take some bread, smother it with delicious butter, expertly stack several pieces of cheese, close the sandwich with a gentle press, place the whole thing in a hot skillet, carefully flip it at just the right time, and, then, once it's perfectly cooked - with crispy, browned bread, and cheese melty and gooey and just this side of being too hot to eat - she tosses the whole thing out the window.

You don't want that. Nobody wants that.

What you want is for the cook to put your grilled cheese sandwich on a plate and send it out to you.

```python
favorite_golden_girl = input("Who's your favorite Golden Girl? ")
```

In the code above `favorite_golden_girl` acts like a plate for your grilled cheese sandwich. It is a _variable_. A variable is a container for data. It has a _name_ and a _value_. In this case the name is `favorite_golden_girl` and the value is whatever the user typed into the terminal.

That last point about the _value_ of `favorite_golden_girl` is important. You, the programmer, cannot see the value of the variable. You know it's something, but not exactly what it is.

We can use the variable without knowing its value.

```python
print("You said your favorite Golden Girl is " + favorite_golden_girl)
```

The code above will always print "You said your favorite Golden Girl is ", but what it prints next is whatever the user typed in. It could be anything. If the user typed in "Dorothy", the message "You said your favorite Golden Girl is Dorothy" would be printed. If the user typed in "a badger with a top hat", the message "You said your favorite Golden Girl is a badger with a top hat" would be printed.

### String Concatenation

Let's take another look at the printing part of our code.

```python
print("You said your favorite Golden Girl is " + favorite_golden_girl)
```

You'll notice that we use the plus (`+`) sign to join the text to the variable. This is a way to join the two together.

It's kinda like adding two numbers. If you join 2 and 2, you get 4. If you join "Monkey" and "Butler", you get "MonkeyButler'.

In code we use the term _"string"_ to refer to text data and when we write code to join to strings together, we use the exceedingly fancy term, _"concatenation"_.

We can concatenate as many strings as we want.

```python
"All the Golden Girls are great, but " + favorite_golden_girl + " is definitely the best!"
```

## Text vs Numbers

### Getting a number

`input()` can only be used to get text from a user. This is often sufficient, but there are times when you'll want to get a number. To get a number we have to do a bit more work.

```python
num_tigers = int(input("What's the optimal number of tigers in a public restroom? ")

if num_tigers > 0:
    print("That's more tigers than I'd prefer.")
else:
    print("That seems about right.")
```

Notice that instead of `input("Prompt text ")`, the code above uses `int(input("Prompt text "))`. The `int()` converts the text into a number, specifically an integer.

> **NOTE:** This code assumes that our user will provide the correct input. If they type something other than digits like "1" or "2", let's just say it won't work as expected. Making code resilient to unexpected input is something that you'll learn more about as you continue learning how to be a software developer, but for now we'll trust our user to provide the correct input.

### Printing a number

When it comes to printing a number as part of a message, we have to do the opposite. We must convert the number back to text.

```python
the_answer = 42
print("The answer is " + str(the_answer))
```

Notice the user of `str()` in the code above. `str()` will convert a number into a string of text.

> **NOTE:** If the above text vs number stuff is confusing, don't worry. We'll be spending more time on this topic later on in the course. For now just remember to use `int(input())` to get a number and `str()` when printing a number.
