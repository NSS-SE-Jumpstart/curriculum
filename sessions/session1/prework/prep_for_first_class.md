# Preparing for the First Class

## Preparing your computer

Prior to the first class session you will need to do a few things to prepare your computer.

### Ensure you have administrative rights

You will need administrative rights on your computer for this course. Having _"administrative rights"_ means the username/password you enter when you login to the computer has permission to install software and change settings on the computer.

If you are unsure about the rights of your user account use the instructions below to verify your rights.

#### In Windows

1. Select the _Start button_ (in the lower-left corner of the screen) and type the words `Control Panel`.
1. Click on the _Control Panel_ app to start it.
1. In the _Control Panel_ window, select _User Accounts_, then _Change your account type_.
1. Make sure _Administrator_ is selected. If you can't select the Administrator option, contact the person who has administrator rights on your computer and ask them to give you rights.
1. Close the _Control Panel_ window.

#### In macOS

1. Click the _Apple_ menu (in the upper-left corner of the screen) and select _System Preferences_.
1. In the _System Preferences_ window, under _System_, select _Accounts_.
1. Select your user account and view the right panel. If `Allow user to administer this computer` isn't checked, you don't have administrative rights and you will need to ask someone with administrative rights to give you rights.
1. Close the _System Preferences_ window.

#### In Linux

If you can run commands with `sudo` you should be ok.

### Install Slack

Slack is a text-based, instant messaging application similar to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or any number of other messaging tools you may have used. Slack is popular amongst development teams and it's free, which is why we use it at NSS.

You should download and install Slack from this website: <https://slack.com/downloads/>

You might also want to check out Slack's [Quick Start Guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide).

> **NOTE:** Slack has a mobile app that you may wish to install, but it is not required.

### Install Zoom

Zoom is popular video conferencing software. We use Zoom to host remote classrooms.

You should download and install Zoom from this website: <https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting>

You might also want to check out Zooms's [Getting Started Guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/categories/200101697).

> **NOTE:** Zoom has a mobile app that you may wish to install, but it is not required.

### Course Material and GitHub Account

The course material is hosted on a platform called GitHub _(the website you are on right now)_. GitHub is commonly known a service used by developers to store their code. However, most GitHub functionality is beyond the scope of this course. We'll use it as a place to host course content and to have online discussions.

You will need to create a free GitHub account for this course. Follow this link to create your account: <https://github.com/signup>

The course material is located here: <https://github.com/NSS-Software-Engineering/Jumpstart>

### Additional Installations

On the first day of class we will install a few more tools, but if you'd like to get a jump on those installations, you can find instructions [here](../classroom/installations.md).

## Preparing yourself

1. **Be prepared to be a few minutes early to class.** Class will start on time and being a little early will give you time to get settled and to resolve any connection issues that might occur.
1. **Set up your computer in a quiet, distraction-free environment.** This course will require a lot of concentration and deep thought. Your environment will have a great impact on your ability to focus.
    > **NOTE:** We know this is sometimes easier said than done, but do your best.
1. **Be prepared to take notes.** Some people find hand writing notes to be an effective way to boost their memory. Others prefer typing up notes. Either approach is fine.
1. **Be prepared to ask questions.** Remember your instructors don't have magic access to your mind to know what topics you need clarified. They need you to speak up. Also, remember your question is NOT dumb.
1. Finally, and most importantly, **be prepared to be challenged, because this class will be difficult**. There will be times when you do not understand what's happening. This is **NORMAL**. It's also something many students struggle with. Not understanding something, and _admitting_ that you don't understand something, is often uncomfortable. One way to prepare for this is to begin to cultivate a [growth mindset](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/growth-mindset).

Also if you haven't read the [course introduction](course_intro.md), please do so.
