# Lightning Exercises

These lightning exercises are centered around selling a 1988 Nissan Sentra.

> **NOTE:** Obviously if you were so fortunate to have such a prize, you'd never sell it, but just play along for the sake of education.

You should create a new Python file for these exercises. Do not overwrite the Python file from the previous lightning exercises.

**REMEMBER TO TEST AFTER YOU FINISH WRITING THE CODE** <sub>please</sub>

## Exercise 1

Write code to print `"CAR SALE!"` and  run it to test that it works.

## Exercise 2

1. Prompt the user to enter their name and save it into a variable.

## Exercise 3

In this exercise, you'll force the user to enter at least something for their name, and you won't except an empty string.

1. Use an `if` statement to determine if the name is equal to (`==`) an empty string (`""`). If it is, prompt the user to enter their name again (one time).
1. Display a message that greets the user by their name.
1. You'll have to run the code multiple times to properly test it.
    1. Test that it works properly if the user enters a name.
    1. Test that it works properly if the user enters an empty string.

## Exercise 4

An `if` statement isn't enough to prevent the user from entering a blank string. Update your code to replace the `if` statement with a `while` loop. The `while` loop should run until the user enters a non-blank string for their name.

## Exercise 5

1. Add code to your program to ask the user how much they would pay you for the Nissan. Save the response to a variable.
1. Convert the user's response into an `int` and save it to a variable.
1. Create an `if/elif/else` statement that does the following:

    * If the user enters a number greater than or equal to `100000`, print `"SOLD!"`
    * If you user enters a number less than or equal to `5000`, print `"Don't you see the majesty of this vehicle???"`
    * Else print `"I'll have to think about it."`
