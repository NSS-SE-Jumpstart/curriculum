Imagine you are writing a program to keep track of items you need to purchase from the grocery store.

```python
item = "milk"
item1 = "cheese"
item2 = "eggs"
item3 = "bread"

print("Buy these groceries:")
print(item)
print(item1)
print(item2)
print(item3)
```

This program is ok, but it's not great. What if you also needed cereal?
