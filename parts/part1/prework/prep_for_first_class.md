# Preparing for the First Class

# WIP

## Setting up your computer

Prior to the first class session you will need to do a few things to prepare your computer.

## Ensure you have administrative rights

## Install Slack

Slack is a text-based, instant messaging application similar to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or any number of other messaging tools you may have used. Slack is popular amongst development teams and it's free, which is why we use it at NSS.

You can download and install Slack from this website: https://slack.com/downloads/

## Install Zoom

Zoom is popular video conferencing software. We use Zoom to host remote classrooms.

## Bookmark course material

The course material is hosted on a platform called GitHub. GitHub is commonly known a service used by developers to store their code. However, most GitHub functionality is beyond the scope of this course. We'll simply use it as a place to host course content.
