# The Python Shell

# WIP

Brainstorming 

prior to this do an intro the the command line

Be clear that this is a demonstration to get us started, but the repl is still a widely used tool

Show how to start
Show how to quit
Get them to start again

Show simple addition of two numbers

Add a third number

But what do these numbers mean?
Introduce variables to name the numbers
The variable name is an item on a shopping list
It's value us the price - integers only 

Print a few individual variables 
Do addition using variables
It's so much more clear now what these numbers mean!
