# The Python Shell

# WIP

## Brainstorming a plan...

prior to this do an intro the the command line

Be clear that this is a demonstration to get us started, but the repl is still a widely used tool

Show how to start
Show how to quit
Get them to start again

Show simple addition of two numbers

Add a third number

But what do these numbers mean?
Introduce variables to name the numbers
The variable name is an item on a shopping list
It's value us the price - integers only 

Print a few individual variables 
Do addition using variables
It's so much more clear now what these numbers mean!

Eventually we make a list with the variables
A shopping list
Print shopping liat
Show len() and sum() of shopping list

Switch to strings
Write code to pick a restaurant for you and your friends
List of restaurant names
Print list
Get a particular restaurant by index
Choose a random restaurant with random.choice()
Join restaurant names with a ", "



## Random thoughts

Is it possible to play sounds from the repl?
Would have to work cross-platform


An instult generator - https://www.surrealists.co.uk/insult

We can give them a function to paste into the repl. 
It should do something fun
