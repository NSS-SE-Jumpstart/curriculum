# Let's Write Some Code

# WIP

As we discussed in [What is code, anyway](../prework/what_is_code.md), software is made by stringing together words and symbols in a particular programming language. In short it's written in code.

Here's the simplest possible Python program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Let's create this program together.

1. In your terminal, create a `hello` folder within your `workspace` folder.

   ```sh
   cd workspace
   mkdir hello
   cd hello
   ```

1. Open Visual Studio Code in the `hello` folder.

   ```sh
   code .
   ```

1. In the Visual Studio Code file explorer, click the New File icon and create a file called `hello_world.py`.

     * --_**NEED AN ANIMATED GIF**_--

1. Type in the following Python code into the `hello_world.py` file.

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

1. Save the `hello_world.py` file using the `Save` option in the `File` menu.

1. Go back to your terminal window to run the program.

   ```sh
   python3 hello_world.py
   ```

You should be welcomed by a friendly, albeit kinda boring, greeting.
