# Installing Software for the Class

Instructions for installing the following tools can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/) or you can find direct links below.

## Python

We'll be using the Python programming language in this class. We'll be using version 3 in this course. It is commonly referred to as _python3_.

It's possible, though unlikely, that you already have Python installed. To determine if Python is already installed on your computer, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/2-python-programming-language).

If you do not have python installed follow these [installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/3-exercise-install-python3).

> **NOTE:** The instructions imply you should install python version **3.9**. However, since they were written python version **3.10** was released. Although it probably won't matter in this introductory course, it's best to install the latest version, so if you have version **3.10** (or higher) you should be good.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (aka, VS Code) is a program we'll use to write and edit code.

To install VS Code follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/4-exercise-install-visual-studio-code).

## Visual Studio Code Python Extension

This is an addition to Visual Studio Code that lets us create and edit Python code.

To install the VS Code Python Extension follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/5-exercise-install-python-extension).
