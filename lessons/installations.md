# Installing Software for the Class

As we're getting started, we'll need a few tools.

## Python

We'll be using the Python programming language in this class.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (aka, VS Code) is a program we'll use to write and edit code.

## Windows Terminal (for Windows computers only)

We'll use the "terminal" in the course to run our Python programs, as well as, execute other commands. Mac and Linux computers already have a good terminal, but it's a separate installation for Windows computers.

## Slack

We'll use slack to communicate throughout the course.

## Zoom

Classes will meet remotely using Zoom for video conferencing.
