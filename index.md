Welcome to the Nashville Software School Software Engineering Jumpstart Course. We’re glad you’re here!

</div>

In this course you’ll begin your coding journey. It will be a long trip with many twists and turns along the way that will eventually lead you deep into the mysteries of software engineering. This course won’t take you all the way to the end, but it’ll set you off in the right direction. And (hopefully) we’ll have a little fun doing it.

Before class begins, please set aside two to three hours to work through the following content. These documents will introduce you to the course as well as walk you through installing some software you'll need. You should do this at least a few days before class begins.

1. [Preparing for the first class](./sessions/session1/prework/prep_for_first_class.md)
1. [Course Introduction](./sessions/session1/prework/course_intro.md)
1. [What is code, anyway?](./sessions/session1/prework/what_is_code.md)

We'll see you soon!
