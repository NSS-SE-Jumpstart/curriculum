Welcome to the Nashville Software School Software Engineering Jumpstart Course. We’re glad you’re here!

</div>

In this course you’ll begin your coding journey. It will be a long trip with many twists and turns along the way that will eventually lead you deep into the mysteries of software engineering. This course won’t take you all the way to the end, but it’ll set you off in the right direction. And (hopefully) we’ll have a little fun doing it.

Before you start your first class session, set aside an hour or two to work through the following content:

1. [Preparing for the first class](./sessions/session1/prework/prep_for_first_class.md)
1. [Course Introduction](./sessions/session1/prework/course_intro.md)
1. [What is code, anyway?](./sessions/session1/prework/what_is_code.md)

We'll see you soon!
